            <p>
              There's something of an open secret in the cybersecurity world:
              internet service providers quietly give away detailed information
              about which computer is communicating with another to private
              businesses, which then sells access to that data to a range of
              third parties, according to multiple sources in the threat
              intelligence industry.

              ONE OF the most prominent figures in China’s tech sector and
              author of “AI 2041” tells Anne McElvoy how artificial intelligence
              will have changed the world in twenty years’ time. They discuss
              the impact machine learning will have on jobs and why an algorithm
              could spot the next pandemic. Plus, can a robot ever replicate
              human emotion?
