            <h1>
              How Data Brokers Sell Access to the Backbone of the Internet
            </h1>
            <p>
              There's something of an open secret in the cybersecurity world:
              internet service providers quietly give away detailed information
              about which computer is communicating with another to private
              businesses, which then sells access to that data to a range of
              third parties, according to multiple sources in the threat
              intelligence industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information, known as netflow data, is a useful tool for
              digital investigators. They can use it to identify servers being
              used by hackers, or to follow data as it is stolen. But the sale
              of this information still makes some people nervous because they
              are concerned about whose hands it may fall into.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I'm concerned that netflow data being offered for commercial
              purposes is a path to a dark fucking place," one source familiar
              with the data told Motherboard. Motherboard granted multiple
              sources anonymity to speak more candidly about industry issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              At a high level, netflow data creates a picture of traffic flow
              and volume across a network. It can show which server communicated
              with another, information that may ordinarily only be available to
              the server owner or the ISP carrying the traffic. Crucially, this
              data can be used for, among other things, tracking traffic through
              virtual private networks, which are used to mask where someone is
              connecting to a server from, and by extension, their approximate
              physical location.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team Cymru, one threat intelligence firm, works with ISPs to
              access that netflow data, three sources said. Keith Chu,
              communications director for the office of Senator Ron Wyden which
              has been conducting its own investigations into the sale of
              sensitive data, added that Team Cymru told the office "it obtains
              netflow data from third parties in exchange for threat
              intelligence."
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies that may source Team Cymru's data include cybersecurity
              firms hired to respond to data breaches or proactively hunt out
              hackers. On its website, Team Cymru says it works with both public
              and private sector teams to "to help identify, track and stop bad
              actors both in cyber space and on the ground."
            </p>
            <p>
              "I'm less worried about a bad guy hacker and more worried about a
              bad guy government or company or politician," one source familiar
              with the data said. A source in the threat intelligence industry
              added that they "always thought it was kinda bonkers," referring
              to Team Cymru's sale of netflow data.
            </p>
            <p>
              The continued sale of sensitive data could present its own privacy
              and security concerns, and the news highlights that ISPs are
              providing this data at scale to third parties likely without the
              informed consent of their own users. Other companies, such as
              cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, also have access to netflow
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The users almost certainly don't [know]" their data is being
              provided to Team Cymru, who then sells access to it, the source
              familiar with the data said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team Cymru's customers can probe a dataset, and "effectively run
              queries against virtually any IP to pull the netflows to and from
              that IP over a given point in time," one of the sources said. Chu
              added Team Cymru said it "restricts the amount of data that is
              returned, so that only a small portion of the netflow data in its
              database can be accessed by any one client."
            </p>
            <p>
              "Visibility and insight are global," the description adds. An
              image included in the brochure shows Team Cymru's product letting
              users trace the activity of servers linked to an Iranian hacking
              group further than other datasets, such as DNS lookups.
